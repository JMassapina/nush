nush
====

Nush, is a threaded, graphical, Python3 shell that wraps CherryPy, ws4py and some slightly
irresponsable magic to tightly integrate Chrome.

If that doesn't sound like fun, you probably won't like it.


**NOTE:** *While the software generally works, and can be used as documented, the API is not
stable. It is released as a prototype for interested parties to hack on.*

Nush is currently unpackaged, so you'll need to clone the repo and run `python3 nush/main.py`.

Nush is GPLv3 licensed. Please flick through the wiki for more information on how to use it.
