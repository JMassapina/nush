nush
====

Nush [the trendy new shell] is a graphical, Python3 and HTML5, interactive development environment that runs in your browser.
It's very easy for new programmers to use, while still being a powerful tool for wizards.

**NOTE:** *While the software generally works, and can be used as documented, the API is not stable.*
*The current version is offered as an open prototype for interested parties to hack on and to share progress.*

The goal is to do a bunch of things for Kano OS...

- provide an integrated environment, a graphical shell, where programming and using Kano are indistinct
- make it simple, light and fun to hack the system and browser
- provide libraries of *orbs*, interesting little Python objects that can be hacked interactively and rendered graphically
- provide tools that help hackers and tech writers develop orbs

Please flick through the [wiki](https://github.com/carlsmith/nush/wiki) for more information on the project
and how to use the software.

Nush is currently unpackaged, but bundles everything it needs. You just need to clone the repo and run it:

    python3 nush/main.py

Nush is currently GPLv3 licensed. It may switch to the MIT license in future, but will remain open source.
