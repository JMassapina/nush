nush
====

Nush, is a threaded, graphical, Python3 shell that wraps CherryPy, ws4py and some slightly
irresponsable magic to tightly integrate Chrome.

If that doesn't sound like fun, you probably won't like it.

Nush is currently unpackaged, so you'll need to clone the repo and run `python3 nush/main.py`.

Nush is GPLv3 licensed. Please flick through the wiki for more information on how to use it.
