nush
====

Nush, is a threaded, graphical, Python3 shell that wraps CherryPy, ws4py and some highly
irresponsable magic to tightly integrate Chrome.

If that doesn't sound like fun, you probably won't like it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nush is currently unpackaged, so you'll need to clone the repo, `cd` to the main directory,
then run `python3 main.py`.

Nush is GPLv3 licensed. Please flick through the wiki for more information on how to use it.
