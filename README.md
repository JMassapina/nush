nush
====

Nush [the trendy new shell] is a graphical, Python3 and HTML5, interactive development environment that runs in your browser.
It's very easy for new programmers to use, while still being a powerful tool for wizards.

Nush is being developed to support [Kano OS](http://www.kano.me/). The end goal is to provide an environment for Kano
that will achieve a few things:

- make it simple and fun to learn programming and create graphical applications that do useful things
- teach computing and test skills by getting kids hacking *foos*, mysterious Python objects that can be
  imported and explored interactively and are rendered using all the latest HTML5 chrome
- provide tools that make it easier to use Kano and develop awesome foos

Please flick through the [wiki](https://github.com/carlsmith/nush/wiki) for more information on the project
and how to use the software.

Nush is currently unpackaged, but bundles everything it needs. You just need to clone the repo and run it:

    python3 nush/main.py

Nush is currently GPLv3 licensed. It may switch to the MIT license in future, but will remain open source.
