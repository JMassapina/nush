nush
====

nush [the trendy new shell] is an interactive development environment for Kano OS, based around Python
and HTML5. It's very easy for new programmers to use, while still being a powerful tool for wizards.

Nush is being developed to support [Kano](http://www.kano.me/). Please flick through the
[wiki](https://github.com/carlsmith/nush/wiki) for more information on the project and
how to use the software.

Nush is currently unpackaged, but bundles everything it needs. You just need to clone the repo and run it:

    python3 nush/main.py

Nush is GPLv3 licensed. It may switch to the MIT license in future, but will always be totally open source.
